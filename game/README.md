# Phaser Examples

This is the Phaser Examples repository.
If you're looking for the framework itself, please go here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source game framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 games. It uses [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) internally for fast 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering. This repository is specifically for all of the Examples we produce to go with it.

## Learn By Example

Phaser comes with an ever growing suite of Examples. Personally we feel that you learn better by looking at small refined code examples. So we created over 250 of them, and create new ones to test nearly every feature added to Phaser. Inside this `examples` repo you'll find the current set. If you write a particularly good example then please send it to us.

The examples need to be run through a local web server (in order to avoid file access permission errors from your browser). You can use your own web server, or start the included web server using grunt.

Using a locally installed web server browse to the examples folder:

    examples/index.html

Alternatively in order to start the included web server, after you've cloned the repo, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then `grunt connect` to start a local server. After running this command you should be able to access your local webserver at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. Then browse to the examples folder: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/examples/index.html`

There is a 'Side View' example viewer as well as the default. This loads all the examples into a left-hand frame for faster navigation.

You can also browse all [Phaser Examples](http://examples.phaser.io) online.


## Contributing

- If you find a bug in an example then please report it on [GitHub Issues][issues] or our [Support Forum][forum].

- You can issue Pull Requests for new examples or fixes to existing ones against the `master` branch.

- If you have a feature request, or have written a game or demo that shows Phaser in use, then please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you! Either post to our [forum][forum] or email: rich@photonstorm.com
